# PlantSite
personal project to showcase my react and css skills(ongoing)
## Description
a landing page focused on the visual aspect, with a responsive design and interactive user experience.
## Skills
In the process of creating this site, i learned more about animation, interaction and other visual effects. As the design did not include UX, I improvised in my own way by adding engaging hovering and click effects, that way the user interaction would feel more organic.
Also, this was my first react project, and when working I learned about props, worked more with arrow functions, useState and objects in react. I enjoyed organising the components and structuring all the elements in an efficient and readable way.
## Design
The visual design was created by the skilled @dsingr on figma, here is the link to the design of this particular project:
